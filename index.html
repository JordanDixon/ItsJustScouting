           Their mother Jamie remembers their early experiences with the scouts. “They would let the girls do the crafts with them. They’d let them come along to stuff. But still, when they sat down to do their memorization stuff, the girls were like, ‘Well, why can’t we need that?’ So, they realize that they weren’t part of it and they didn’t like that it was only for boys.”

            The McCombs family is a busy family of five; splitting their time between two scouting organizations was not practical. “Everyone wants their kids to grow, learn and be happy. We thought of Girls Scouts, but it wasn’t a right fit, and we were already involved in Boy Scouts because of Henry. As soon as we heard that girls could join, it wasn’t even a question,” said Jamie.

        <p> To the girls, the choice was easy. “I don’t think there is that much of a difference between the two,” said Maevry, “I just like Boy Scouts better.”</p>

  <p>During the last decade, membership has declined in youth scouting organizations. Some claim this why BSA is pushing for change. No matter the reason, the organization has made progressive strides in recent years. According to their website, BSA lifted the ban on openly gay scout leaders in 2015. In 2017, BSA allowed open membership for transgender youth, accepting the gender listed on the application form instead of the birth certificate.
<br><br>
In 2018, girls were first allowed to join the Cub Scout Program due to a new recruitment effort called “Scout Me In.” The 110-year-old organization made the decision in order to allow both boys and girls a chance at the scouting experience.

        <h3 id="lawsuit-heading">History</h3>
        <p class="lawsuit">The overall scouting movement started over 108 years ago, in 1910; the program was to engage in values set by the Boy Scouts of America. “Scouting is a values-based program with its code of conduct. The Scout Oath and Law help instill the values of good conduct, respect for others, and honesty. Scouts learn skills that will last a lifetime, including basic outdoor skills, first aid, citizenship skills, leadership skills, and how to get along with others.” 
        <br><br> 
        <img class="archive" src="img/girl-scout-archive.jpg">
            <br><br>
        Two years later Girl Scouts, GSUSA, began in 1912 with the vision and direction of Juliette Gordon Low. Low wanted an organization that gave girls courage, confidence and built character so that girls would prepare for the world. According to the GSUSA website, “Juliette, affectionately known as “Daisy” by her family and close friends, gathered 18 girls in her hometown of Savannah, Georgia. So she could share what she had learned abroad about a new outdoor and educational program for youth, and with this, the Girl Scout Movement was born. Along with Juliette, these first Girl Scouts blazed trails and redefined what was possible for themselves and girls everywhere.”

        <img class="archive" src="img/boy-scout-archive.jpg">
             <br><br> 
        Recent years membership has been declining in youth scouting organizations, which some claim is the push for change in Boy Scouts of America. However, the organization has been making more progressive strides in the past recent years. In 2015 BSA lifted the ban on openly gay scout leaders and had open membership for transgender youth, accepting the gender on application form instead of the birth certificate.

     <h3 id="lawsuit-heading">The Lawsuit</h3> 
    
      <br>
      <p class="lawsuit">GSUSA released a statement, and while not actually mention Scouts of BSA, they wrote, “We believe strongly in the importance of the all-girl, girl-led, and girl-friendly environment that Girl Scouts provides, which creates a free space for girls to learn and thrive. The benefit of the single-gender environment has been well-documented by educators, scholars, other girl- and youth-serving organizations.”
      <br><br>
      The new transition for Boy Scouts of America means a new name. They plan on dropping the word boy from the title, a move to welcome girls, and go by Scouts BSA. The name change sparked concern from GSUSA. So much that they filed a federal trademark lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York claiming that Scouts BSA will “marginalize” and damage GSUSA.  Boy Scouts has two programs, one is Scouts BSA, which is for boys and girls 11-17. The other is the new Cub Scout campaign called “Scout Me In,” which promotes family scouting and involvement. According to NPR, “It’s the generic use of “Scouts,” without a gender marker, that the Girl Scouts 
      object to.” 
      <br><br>
      The argument over the generic use of Scouts has long been an argument, dating back to the creation of Girl Scouts. “Khaki uniforms and adoption of military drills” was found threatening by Boy Scout leaders during that time. As they felt other youth organizations like the Camp Fire Girls were more gender appropriate,” Leslie Paris writes in her book Children’s Nature: The Rise of the American Summer Camp, “James West, BSA leader from 1911 to 1943, rallied particularly against the Girl Scouts’ use of the term ‘scout,’ fearing that if the term became feminized, it would become unsuitable for boys’ adventure.”

	hikes and other actives. 
        <br><br>
	“Both Tony and Rogers were super accommodating. They would let the girls do the crafts with them. They’d let them come along to stuff. But still, you know, when they sat down to do their memorization stuff, neighboring down were like, well why can’t we need that? So they, they realize that they weren’t part of it and they didn’t like that it was only for boys,” 
	said Jamie. 
         <br><br>
	Girls tagging along and participating with brothers or family members in Cub Scouts is not out of the ordinary. Durmn, himself had a daughter who has participated with her brothers and became apart of Venture Crew when she was older. “She really wasn’t able to participate in, in scouting in the way that these girls are obviously, you know, at that point rank was never even a question. But she went on the family campouts with us and everything and loved, you know, looking for crayfish in the, in the creek and playing, you know, all this stuff the boys did.”</p>

We thought of Girl Scouts, but it wasn’t a right fit, and we were already involved in Boy Scouts because of Henry. So as soon as we heard that girls could join, it wasn’t even a question.”

        Adele and Mavery stand in the back of the pack. They salute the flag as it jumps up the flagpole, a small Cub Scout yanks on the rope to get it up on the flag. It was time for the first activity, A 3-mile hike to the highest point of Camp Kootaga.

        It is 8:00 a.m and a large group of 4th and 5th graders are hiking in the woods. Some more excited boys run ahead of the group. Adele and Mavery stay up front in the group. They pause to look at a mushroom, Mavery picks up a large stick. She pokes it while making a face. They make it to the smooth and weather rock caves; the girls climb inside alongside some of the boys. The day is jam pack with activities, once Mavery and Adele and the other  Webelos hike back to camp; they are whisk away to the next adventure. “All right gentlemen,” says one of the Boy Scout leaders that are directing the next activity. Mavery and Adele sat at the table also.

Seven Ranges has been operated under the Buckeye Council since 1987 and each summer over 5,000 campers gather in Kensington, Ohio. <br>Older Scouts earn work towards merit badges while at the Webelo Resident Camp the girls and other Webelos earn their colors and work towards their arrow of light, which is the only badge a cub scout can carry over to Scouts BSA. <br> <br>
     The Webelo Colors are optional yellow, red, and green emblem onto which the Webelos Activity Badges and Arrow of Light Adventure Pins may be pinned. It is worn on the right sleeve immediately below and touching the U.S. flag. Mavery and Adele last summer earn their Craftsman badge and the Aquanaut badge.</p>
